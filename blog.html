                     Session Storage: <br>
                     A browsing session approximates your use of a website. If you visit a site, browse around for a
                     bit, then turn off your computer, you can think of that time as a single session. Your browser
                     configuration may change this in subtle ways, but a session aims to represent the chunk of time you
                     interact with a site.

                     Session storage is unique to each browser tab. If you open a new tab and navigate to the same site,
                     you'll start a new session with its own storage. However, if you use a "duplicate tab" feature in
                     your browser, that may reuse the same session. You can't rely too much on the specific details of a
                     "session". Instead, focus on the core concept: session storage is temporary.

                     What Is Local Storage: <br>
                     Local storage maintains data across all instances of a site, whether they're in different tabs or
                     windows. It is also permanent, so the data won't disappear when you close your browser.

                     When you open a website that previously used local storage, it will always have access to that
                     stored data.

                     As a web developer, you can use this mechanism to retain data about a user. Some websites might use
                     this to keep you logged in or provide a more personalized experience.

                     Like session storage, you can set a local storage object with one line of JavaScript code:
                     While session storage clears data as soon as the session ends, the only way to clear local storage
                     is to explicitly delete it. Both storage types offer two methods to clear data. The first removes a
                     specific item of data based on its key:
                  </p>

                     Global scope: <br>
                     In a programming environment, the global scope is the scope that contains, and is visible in, all
                     other scopes. In client-side JavaScript, the global scope is generally the web page inside which
                     all the code is being executed
                  </p>

                  <p>
                     Block scope: <br>
                     Block scoping means declaring a variable, not just inside a function, but around any curly brackets
                     like if statements or loops. The variable itself let i is still in memory, but the engine just
                     won't allow you to access it like before when we used var
